## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Common Opening:
Knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful structures for organizing and retrieving information in AI systems. Recent advances in Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) have shown promise for improving context-aware question answering. However, existing approaches primarily rely on simple semantic similarity measures, overlooking the rich structural information available in knowledge graphs.

### Problem Statement:
Current GraphRAG methods face limitations in:
- Utilizing graph topology for relevance scoring
- Handling hierarchical knowledge structures  
- Providing explainable retrieval paths
- Scaling to large knowledge graphs

### Our Contribution:
We propose PageRank-weighted Hierarchical GraphRAG, which addresses these limitations through:

1. **Novel Algorithm:** PageRank-weighted path traversal combining semantic similarity with graph centrality
2. **Hierarchical Architecture:** Multi-level summarization for enhanced context
3. **Evaluation Framework:** Comprehensive comparison using AI-as-a-judge methodology
4. **[Performance/Theoretical] Analysis:** [Empirical validation/Conceptual foundation] of the approach

## 3. METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Problem Formulation
Given:
- Knowledge graph G = (V, E) with nodes V and edges E
- Query q requiring contextual response
- Hierarchical summarization levels L = {1, 2, ..., n}

Objective: Retrieve relevant context C that maximizes answer quality

### 3.2 PageRank-Weighted Scoring
Our core innovation combines semantic similarity with graph structure:

```
Score(n_i) = Sim_semantic(q, n_i) × PathWeight(n_seed → n_i)

where:
- Sim_semantic(q, n_i) = cosine_similarity(E(q), E(n_i))  
- PathWeight = ∏(j=1 to k) w_j × (0.85 + 0.15) // Damping factor
- n_seed = argmax(KNN(E(q), k=1))
```

### 3.3 Hierarchical Graph Construction
1. **Chunk-level nodes:** Original text segments
2. **Summary-level nodes:** Clustered summaries  
3. **Root-level node:** Global context

### 3.4 Search Algorithm
```python
def pagerank_search(query, k_hops=3, top_k=6):
    1. Find seed node via KNN similarity
    2. Perform k-hop traversal with path weight calculation
    3. Apply PageRank-weighted scoring
    4. Return top-k ranked nodes
```
